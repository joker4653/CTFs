# CTFs I have completed over time.


Write ups and basic instructions:


Should first be doing reconassance using tools such as Nmap and manual enumeration by simply visiting the link.
Look for any possible points of ingress, i.e file upload, sql injection, etc.


Find known exploits manually or using tools such as gobuster, find exploit using searchsploit and create a payload for attack

Main goal is getting a reverse shell.
