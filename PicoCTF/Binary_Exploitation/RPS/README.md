At first glance at the source code, I noticed that the way the program checks
if you have won or not is by checking if the respective rock,paper or scissors is
contained within the string inputted by stdin, to exploit this, simply type a string
which contains all 3 possible cases. i.e (rockpaperscissors). This ensures the
program marks you as winning each time. Repeating this 5 times yields the flag
