From analysing the source code, sigseg_handler is what prints the flag out. My understanding
of the name of the function shows that we needed to cause a segmentation fault to get the flag to print
This can be done by manipulating the gets() function. The function does not check for the length of input
and thus, can be manipulated and force overwriting past the intended buffer

Because our expected buffer is 16 characters long, we need to input a string at least > 16 characters long including
a end of char character ('\0'). Trying this simply with a string like 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
forces a seg fault as gets overrides memory incorrectly and the handler function prints our flag out
