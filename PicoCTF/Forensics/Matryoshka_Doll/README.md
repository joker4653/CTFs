WRITEUP:



First checked metadata for anything out of ordinairy..found nothing.


Used Strings to see if there were any outliers hidden in binary
Found the name of another file, which was hinted at by the name of the problem

Using Binwalk I extracted 2_c.jpg from dolls.jpg. I did this 3 more times which finally yielded the flag
